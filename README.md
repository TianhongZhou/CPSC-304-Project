Project Summary 

The idea of this project is an application for an information reference database for individuals who encounter wildlife to check if a species of animal they may not be familiar with is endangered. The domain would be in biology / ecology as information about specific animals can be queried. The database will also provide contact information for potentially specific animal rescue organizations in the local area if an endangered species is injured so proper help and surveying can assist in preserving the animal population.

The domain aspect we are trying to model by this database should allow us to do several functions. The domains we will be modeling include: continents, country, organizations, animals, food, living environment, and threats.
